"""
This script is basically the same as the notebook 1_bias_bios, but with small extensions/changes.
It is meant as a script that you would realistically run on your own dataset and application.
This includes
    - logging to Weights&Biases
    - callbacks
    - how to retrieve your stand-alone end-model after training it with Weasel.
    - differently to the notebook, we will also be adjusting the model's decision threshold on the small validation set.
        This will have small positive effects in this example dataset, but can help quite a bit for unbalanced classes.
It excludes the Snorkel baseline at the bottom of the notebook which was for illustrative purposes.
Note:
    This script will log to Weights&Biases (wandb), which is a great choice for logging,
    but will require you to set up an account to run this if you do not have one yet (and have it pip installed).
